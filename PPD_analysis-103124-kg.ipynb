      "The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, launched a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) survey to assess and advance its efforts toward creating a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. This initiative is centered on fostering an environment that ensures fair treatment for all members, regardless of identity, and is a step toward aligning PPD’s practices with DEI goals. Working closely with the PPD's Interim Director of DEI, the survey was developed and launched on October 23, with a closing date set for November 20. Following the survey's release, PPD’s Director of Communications implemented a comprehensive outreach campaign to encourage maximum participation. Responses were collected both online and mail-in submissions, providing valuable insights into the department’s current climate and areas for improvement in DEI.\n",

    "The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, launched a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) survey to assess and advance its efforts toward creating a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. This initiative is centered on fostering an environment that ensures fair treatment for all members, regardless of identity, and is a step toward aligning PPD’s practices with DEI goals. Working closely with the PPD's Interim Director of DEI, the survey was developed and launched on October 23, with a closing date set for November 20. Following the survey's release, PPD’s Director of Communications implemented a comprehensive outreach campaign to encourage maximum participation. Responses were collected both online and mail-in submissions, providing valuable insights into the department’s current climate and areas for improvement in DEI.\n",

       "'\\nAnalysis on PPD surveys 11/21\\n===============================\\n\\nThe Philadelphia Police Department (PPD), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, launched a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) survey to assess and advance its efforts toward creating a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. This initiative is centered on fostering an environment that ensures fair treatment for all members, regardless of identity, and is a step toward aligning PPD’s practices with DEI goals. Working closely with the PPD\\'s Interim Director of DEI, the survey was developed and launched on October 23, with a closing date set for November 20. Following the survey\\'s release, PPD’s Director of Communications implemented a comprehensive outreach campaign to encourage maximum participation. Responses were collected both online and mail-in submissions, providing valuable insights into the department’s current climate and areas for improvement in DEI.\\n\\nThis report consists of three sections of analysis: **Basic Responses Distribution**, showing the distribution of respondent locations, dates, and progress; **Demographic Distribution**, covering the distributions of gender, race, sworn status, and years of service; and **Answer Distribution and Word Cloud**, displaying the response distributions and a word cloud for open-ended questions.\\n\\n# Basic Responses Distribution\\n\\nWe convert IP address to actual cities and countries. All of the results are in United States and following is the distribution of majority cities with more than 5 devices from 1290 survey responses including 4 mail-in responses:\\n\\n- Philadelphia: 1006 devices\\n- White Plains: 42 devices\\n- New York: 24 devices\\n- Reston: 16 devices\\n- Lansdale: 8 devices\\n- Allentown: 7 devices\\n- St Louis: 7 devices\\n- Dulles: 6 devices\\n- Bensalem: 6 devices\\n- Anaheim: 6 devices\\n\\nWe plot the survey received from each date and its completeness where orange is those fully completed surveys and blue are partially completed surveys:\\n\\n![Survey Distribution by Date](/plots/survey_distribution.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nWe also plot the survey\\'s progress distribution:\\n\\n![Survey Progress Distribution](/plots/progress_distribution.png)\\n\\n\\n# Demographic distribution \\n\\n **Note**: Due to the small number of responses in certain categories, **Non-binary** has been combined with **Other** under gender, and **Native American or Alaskan Native** has been combined with **A race/ethnicity not listed here** in race. \\n\\n## Q36\\n **What is your gender?** \\n\\n- Male: 69.32%\\n- Female: 27.34%\\n- Other: 3.34%\\n\\n## Q37\\n **Which of the following best describes you?** \\n\\n- White or Caucasian: 50.40%\\n- Black or African American: 27.76%\\n- Hispanic or Latino: 8.09%\\n- A race/ethnicity not listed here: 7.55%\\n- Multiracial or Biracial: 4.18%\\n- Asian or Pacific Islander: 2.02%\\n\\n## Q39\\n **Are you a sworn or non-sworn professional employee of the Philadelphia Police Department?** \\n\\n- Sworn: 83.21%\\n- Non-sworn professional: 16.79%\\n\\n## Q39-3\\n **How many years have you been on the force?
